# trim_image_roi
## Trim a 3D volume based on its Volume Of Interest.<br> 
The image and the VOI file are `.nii` files.
<br><br>
After giving the two paths (image and VOI) it will load them, removes the areas we don't care about (using the ROI) then performs the trim.<br>
Here an example:
<img src="other/sample.png" alt="sample"/>
The final size is the best fitting crop of the 3D image.
